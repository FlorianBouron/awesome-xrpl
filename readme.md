## Conventions

The XRPL is a decentralized, immutable, censorship-resistant, distributed-ledger. It is also near instant, and the dameon itself is capable of websockets.

Most projects include an active view of current transactions occuring on the network.

Here are some things to know:

- ðŸ’« = Shows live transactions
- <kbd>M</kbd><kbd>T</kbd><kbd>D</kbd> = Multi-environment, Main, Test, Dev networks are supported.

### XRPL DEX

Stuff related to the built-in [XRPL DEX](https://xrpl.org/decentralized-exchange.html)

#### DEX UI

User Interfaces to the DEX

- [XRP Tookit](https://www.xrptoolkit.com) This tool lets you configure different aspects of any XRPL Wallet/Account. There's also a built-in trading UI.


#### ODL Monitoring

Monitors inter-exchange XRP flows. [ODL is a product offered through RippleNet.](https://ripple.com/ripplenet/on-demand-liquidity/)

- [XRPL ODL Rosetta](https://threexrp.dev) ðŸ’« XRPL ROSETTA monitors movements of XRP between exchanges by listening to the XRPL, it then classifies and buckets the exchange. Naturally ODL traffic will float to the top the longer the tool runs. However active ODL corridors tend to show up pretty fast, simply look for a destination tag with a large count.

### ODL Miscelaneous
