# ‚ú® [XRPL.org](https://xrpl.org) ‚ú®

[XRPL.org](https://xrpl.org) is a great resource for anyone wanting to learn more about the XRPL and how it works.

Feel free to [explore](https://xrpl.org/get-started.html) [there](https://xrpl.org/overview.html) [first](https://xrpl.org/introduction.html)!
([It's](https://xrpl.org/send-a-multi-signed-transaction.html) [really](https://xrpl.org/references.html) [good](https://xrpl.org/technical-faq.html) üò≥)

# Conventions

The XRPL is a decentralized, immutable, censorship-resistant, distributed-ledger. It is also near instant, and the daemon itself is capable of websockets.

Most projects include an active view of current transactions occuring on the network.

Here are some things to know:

- üí´ = Shows live transactions
- <kbd>M</kbd><kbd>T</kbd><kbd>D</kbd> = Multi-environment, Main, Test, Dev networks are supported.

  their trades for producing ODL analytics. Has a public API.

Naturally ODL traffic will float to the top the longer the tool runs. However active ODL corridors tend to show up pretty fast, simply look for a destination tag with a large count.
